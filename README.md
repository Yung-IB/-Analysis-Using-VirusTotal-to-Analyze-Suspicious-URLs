# Threat Intelligence Analysis of Suspicious Domains using VirusTotal

This report details a threat intelligence analysis of three suspicious domains‚Äî`17ebook.com`, `aladel.net`, and `clicnews.com`‚Äîusing the VirusTotal platform. The objective was to assess the potential security risks posed by these domains, including associations with malware, phishing, or other malicious activities.

This analysis serves as a practical demonstration of using a threat intelligence aggregator to perform due diligence and risk assessment on unknown URLs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The analysis was conducted using several core features within the VirusTotal platform to build a comprehensive threat profile for each domain.

* **URL Scanning:** Each domain was submitted to the VirusTotal URL scanner to aggregate detection results from over 90 security vendors and reputation services.
* **Threat Intelligence Exploration:** The "Relations" and "Graph" features were used to visualize the domains' associations with other domains, IPs, and known malware hashes.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** The domains were analyzed for suspicious behaviors such as malicious redirects, file downloads, or communication with known command-and-control servers.
